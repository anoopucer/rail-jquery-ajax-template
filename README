== Template for using JQuery and Rails3 for AJAX transactions   

I wanted to try out various interactions between JQuery 1.4 and Rails 3.0 to see how I could pass various types of data to and from the server. 

Installation:

grab it from github 

git clone git@github.com:triendeau/rail-jquery-ajax-template.git

then run

'rake db:migrate' and 'rake db:seed'

then you should be able to run 'bundle install' & 'rails server'

Suggestions are welcome

Enjoy
